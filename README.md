In order to try this app on your android mobile phone you will need to build an apk and then send it via usb in your phone.
Once you have launched the apk you will have to wait for a specific image to appear on a surface which
you want to place an environmental object provided from the scroll view on the up left corner. Then you just tap the screen and voil√†!
